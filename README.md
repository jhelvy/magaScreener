The app is built using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system, the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/), and the [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) web application framework, leveraging [shinylive](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2022-10-25-shinylive-extension/) Quarto extension to run the whole thing in the browser as a static web page (thanks to [@coatless](https://github.com/coatless) for posting such a great [tutorial](https://github.com/coatless-quarto/r-shinylive-demo) on how to set this up).
