## Source code for the [MAGA Keyword Screener](https://jhelvy.github.io/magaScreener/) app

This tool allows you to analyze documents for specific MAGA-targeted keywords. It is intended to be used to help identify words that might get screened by the federal government, e.g. in a grant proposal for federal funding. Upload a document, and the app will count words, characters, and occurrences of predetermined keywords.

Here's a quick visual demo:

```{r child="description.Rmd"}
```

### Keywords List

The analyzer searches for the following keywords:

```{r}
#| results: asis
#| echo: false

keywords <- read.csv('keywords.csv', header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
names(keywords) <- ''
kableExtra::kbl(keywords, format = 'markdown')
```
