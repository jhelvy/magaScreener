This tool allows you to analyze documents for MAGA-targeted [keywords](https://github.com/jhelvy/magaScreener/blob/main/keywords.csv). You can also upload your own CSV file of keywords. It is intended to be used to help identify words that might get screened by an entity (e.g., the federal government) so you can modify your language accordingly. Just upload a document, and the app will count occurrences of the keywords.
